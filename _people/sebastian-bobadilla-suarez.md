bio: During my PhD, I worked on various different topics such as heuristics and biases in decision-making as well as on models of similarity for neuroimaging data. Currently, I am working on relating models of similarity from fMRI data to models of similarity derived from artificial neural networks. Other efforts include optimizing parameter estimates for GLMs on fMRI data and biomarker exploration thereof.
